***Version Control:***

Version control is a system that manages changes to files over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, keep track of changes, and revert back to previous versions if needed.  

 ***Version Control System:***

A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps in managing and tracking changes to files. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

With a VCS, every change made to a file is recorded and tracked, along with information about who made the change and when. This allows for easy collaboration and coordination among team members.

There are two main types of version control systems: centralized version control systems (CVCS) and distributed version control systems (DVCS).

- **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**
- **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**
- **Collaboration**
- **Change Tracking**
- **Version Management**
- **Branching and Merging**

Overall, version control systems are essential tools for modern software development, providing a structured and efficient way to manage and track changes to files in a collaborative environment.
